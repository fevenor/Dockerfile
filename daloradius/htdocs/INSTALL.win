Windows Installation Notes
==========================

Installation notes as described by Gustavo for daloRADIUS 0.8 are as follows:
Necessary packages to install dalo

    *  apache_2.2.3-win32-x86-no_ssl.msi
    *  php-5.2.3-win32-installer.msi
    *  mysql-5.0.45-win32.zip

Installation tips:

	After install packages and run the mysql script to create radius
	database do the next,

	- change localhost to 127.0.0.1 in config.php (version 0.8), It will
	looks like this

	<?php
	// Database configuration file for daloRADIUS
	// Please fill in the details that match your setup configuration.
	$dbhost = '127.0.0.1:3306'; // set the mysql port too
	$dbuser = 'root';
	$dbpass = 'root'; // set your preferred password
	$dbname = 'radius';
	?>

	This is necessary because by default when mysql detects localhost, It
	try to connect via pipeline in case of tcp/ip.

	- For the first tipe, until dalo runs, create a daloradius folder
	C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Apache2.2\daloradius, and
	restart httpd service.

	- Don't forget to select the Mysql connector  and  GD2 library in PHP
	installation wizard.
