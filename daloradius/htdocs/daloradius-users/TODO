* dologin.php
	fix authenticating the user to have crypt/md5 support because if the user is using crypt-password
	attribute then most probably the password passed in the form is required to be encrypted using crypt()

* pref-userinfo-edit.php
	fix - its possible that the user doesn't have an entry in userinfo, add a check for that, if the user
	doesn't have this entry it is required to ADD the records, not update them.

	the updateby and updatedate fields were removed from the code, check first if it is required to have it
	updates for user changes and if so add support for it
