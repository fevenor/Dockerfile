 daloRADIUS has been tested on Debian sid/unstable and Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
 with apache2, php5 and mysql-server-5 packages but should be able to work
 on older versions of the mentioned packages (apache1, php4 or mysql4).


 OTHER OS/DISTRIBUTIONS
 ======================
 
 daloRADIUS has also been deployed on Windows successfully and is under
 testing and more QA work, thanks to Gustavo Mariani.
 To see Gustavo's installation notes regarding a Microsoft Windows deployment
 please attend to INSTALL.win

 DEBIAN USERS
 ============

 For debian (or ubuntu) users I've put down a list of all packages which you need installed to get
 this running in even less time so that you don't have to spend time on figuring out which packages
 are required and which are not.

 apt-get install apache2
 apt-get install php5-common php5-gd php-pear php-db libapache2-mod-php5 php-mail
 
 Now if you plan on working with mysql as the database server then you need
	1. to install the database server, being mysql.
	2. to install the php5-mysql package which contains the libraries to talk to it
 You would have to do the same if you choose another database server, for example PostgreSQL -
 you would have to install the postgresql database server and php5-pgsql.
 
 Assuming we decide on working with MySQL:
 
 apt-get install php5-mysql 
 apt-get install mysql-server-5.0 

 Note: PHP installations are different on different systems, so please consult the OPTIONAL PHP CONFIGURATION 
       section below if you have any problems.



Upgrading
=========

 UPGRADE PROCESS
 ---------------
 
	1. daloRADIUS Configuration File changes:
	
		daloRADIUS configuration file has changed from the default  daloradius.conf  to   daloradius.conf.php
		so first you will need to adjust your daloradius.conf file to the daloradius.conf.php format (it's pretty much the same, HONEST!)
		and then rename it to daloradius.conf.php
		
		The best way to approach this is simply to copy over the daloradius.conf.php file from 0.9-9 and copy
		it to your 0.9-8 directory and then adjust the configuration parameters accordingly in daloradius.conf.php
	
	2. Extract the tar-ball (daloradius-X.Y.tar.gz) to the same directory of the 
	   previous copy, over-writing all the files. (It is ofcourse always a good practice to backup
	   your files before you do that)
	   
	   
	 Now what's left is the database upgrade and there are 2 ways of doing it:
	   
	 MANUAL UPGRADE
	 ---------------
	3. To upgrade your database through command line using the mysql console simply navigate
	   to the contrib/db directory and load up the migration files until the last one

	   For example, if you currently have 0.9-8 and you're upgrading to 0.9-9
	   then:
		cd /var/www/daloradius-0.9-8/contrib/db
		mysql -u root -p radius < contrib/db/mysql-migrate-0.98-to-0.99.sql
 
 	 GUI UPGRADE
	 ---------------
	3. Version 0.9-9 introduces a new Graphical Upgrade page to ease up the process so simply
	   fire up your browser and navigate to http://localhost/update.php
	
	
	4. It's probably required that you setup read and write permissions on library/daloradius.conf.php so
	   that the webserver can access it to update your configuration options from daloRAIDUS




Installation
============

 1. EXTRACT ARCHIVE
 ------------------
    daloRADIUS homepage is hosted on sourceforge at the address
    of http://sourceforge.net/projects/daloradius/ and you may
    get the latest release from there if you haven't already done so.

    extract the daloradius.tar.gz archive to /var/www

	tar -zxvf daloradius.tar.gz
	cp daloradius/ /var/www -R
	
	
 2. Setting Permissions
 ----------------------
	You also need to change permissions so that the webserver user and group are
	owning daloRADIUS's directory. In Debian the user and group are www-data and
	so we need to do this:
	
	chown www-data:www-data /var/www/daloradius -R
	chmod 644 /var/www/daloradius/library/daloradius.conf.php
	
	The chmod command is for having the daloradius.conf.php configuration file 
	writable by the webserver for easy administration from the web interface.


 3. DATABASE SETUP
 -----------------

    RADIUS Database already exist
	-----------------------------
	This means that you already have a radius database in mysql because you created it
	when you installed FreeRADIUS and used FreeRADIUS's supplied schema.sql
	
	In this case, all that you are missing is daloRADIUS's related database schema and so
	simply install it:
	
		cd contrib/db
		mysql -u root -p radius < mysql-daloradius.sql
	

    Fresh install of daloRADIUS (and possibly FreeRADIUS)
	-----------------------------------------------------
	This means that you are working with mysql database as your storage backend for
	FreeRADIUS for the first time and so you DON'T have any radius database already
	created in mysql.
	
	Firstly, create the radius database in mysql:
		mysqladmin create radius
	
	If this is the case then you have 2 options:
		A. If you are working with FreeRADIUS 1.X then:
				mysql -u root -p radius < fr1-mysql-daloradius-and-freeradius.sql
		B. If you are working with FreeRADIUS 2.X then:
				mysql -u root -p radius < fr2-mysql-daloradius-and-freeradius.sql
	

 4. DATABASE CONNECTION SETUP
 ----------------------------

    Now, simply adjust the MySQL database information in 
    daloRADIUS's config file.

		cd library/
		vi daloradius.conf.php
   
    Fill in the database details and you're done.
    Save the file and exit.

	Notice: make sure that the file in library/daloradius.conf is writable
	  (and ofcourse readable) by the webserver user and group.

	  
	  
 5. INSTALLATION COMPLETE
 ------------------------
    Surf to http://yourip/daloradius
    Login:
		username: administrator
		password: radius

    Notice: don't forget to change the default password in the Configuration -> Operators page
			don't forget to also REMOVE completely or rename to some random undetected name the update.php script!

 
 [OPTIONAL PHP CONFIGURATION]
 ============================

 I have noticed that on Debian 4.0 (etch) when the php5-mysql package is installed the
 php.ini file is created with the extensions commented. To fix it just uncomment it, 
 like so:

    vi /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
    # comment out both of these as they are required:
    extension=mysql.so
    extension=gd.so
	extension=db.so
  
 Restart apache and everything should be ok.
